    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pasta is a staple food in Italian cuisine and is loved by people worldwide. It's made from durum wheat flour or semolina and water, mixed into a dough, shaped into various forms, and then cooked by boiling. There are numerous types of pasta, each with its own unique shape, texture, and culinary uses.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>Water (as needed)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>On a clean work surface, mound the flour and create a well in the center.</li>
    <li>Crack the eggs into the well and add salt.</li>
    <li>Using a fork, gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>If the dough is too dry, add a little water, a teaspoon at a time, until the dough comes together. If it's too sticky, add a bit more flour.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Dust your work surface and rolling pin with flour.</li>
    <li>Take one portion of dough and flatten it slightly with your hands.</li>
    <li>Roll out the dough into a thin sheet, about 1/8 inch thick, using the rolling pin. Dust with more flour as needed to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
    <li>Carefully add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package instructions or until al dente (cooked but still firm to the bite).</li>
    <li>Fresh pasta usually cooks much faster than dried pasta, typically within 1-3 minutes depending on the thickness.</li>
    <li>Drain the cooked pasta and toss it with your favorite sauce and toppings.</li>
    </ol>
