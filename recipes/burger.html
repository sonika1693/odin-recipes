    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A burger, short for hamburger, is a popular sandwich consisting of a cooked patty of ground meat placed between two slices of bread (usually a bun). Burgers are often served with various toppings and condiments, making them a versatile and customizable meal.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>1 pound ground beef (preferably 80/20 or 85/15 lean-to-fat ratio)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>4 burger buns</li>
    <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
    <li>Tomato slices</li>
    <li>Onion slices</li>
    <li>Pickle slices</li>
    <li>Cheese slices (optional)</li>
    <li>Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise (or your preferred condiments)</li>
    <li>Cooking oil or butter for grilling</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat your grill, stovetop griddle, or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Divide the ground beef into four equal portions and gently shape them into patties, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Make an indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent it from puffing up while cooking.</li>
    <li>Season both sides of each patty generously with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>If using a grill, brush the grates with oil to prevent sticking. Place the patties on the grill and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare to medium doneness, or longer if you prefer well-done burgers. Avoid pressing down on the patties with a spatula as it can release juices and dry out the meat.</li>
    <li>If using a stovetop griddle or skillet, heat some oil or butter and cook the patties for the same amount of time per side until they reach your desired level of doneness.
</li>
    <li>While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the burger buns on the grill or in a separate skillet until they are golden brown.</li>
    <li>Spread ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, or your preferred condiments on the bottom half of each bun.</li>
    <li>Place a lettuce leaf on top of the sauce.</li>
    <li>Add a tomato slice, onion slice, and pickle slices on top of the lettuce.</li>
    <li>If using cheese, place a slice on each cooked patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
    <li>Place the cooked patty on top of the toppings.</li>
    <li>Complete the burger by placing the top half of the bun over the patty.</li>
    </ol>
